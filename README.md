# 3DRenderer
A simple 3D Renderer, which may be added to a Game Engine project later down the line.

Most of the code here was made following a tutorial by javidx9 on Youtube, from part 1 of his 3D engine coding series. However,
I translated it to SFML, and am hoping to add some of my own features to better understand the process of 3D rendering.
